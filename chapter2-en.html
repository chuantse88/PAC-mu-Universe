<h1>Chapter 2: Axioms (SUMS–1 to SUMS–6)</h1>

<p>The core of the PAC–μ framework is built upon six axioms of spectral ontology, collectively referred to as <strong>SUMS</strong> (Spectral Universal Modal Structures). Each axiom not only defines a mathematical structure but governs the fundamental mechanisms of existence, transformation, cognition, causality, and compression in the universe.</p>

<h2>SUMS–1: Spherical Harmonic Mode Expansion Axiom</h2>
<p>All forms of existence in the universe are fundamentally expressed as expansions on spherical harmonic modal bases.<br>
Existence = spectral modes; Structure = vibration; State = combinations of modal indices.</p>

<h2>SUMS–2: Dirac Spectral Geometry Axiom</h2>
<p>The source of geometry, matter, and interaction lies in the spectral structure of the Dirac operator D.<br>
Space = spectral distance; Physics = perturbation of spectral structures.</p>

<h2>SUMS–3: Fractal Topology and Spectral Dimension Axiom</h2>
<p>The universe is fundamentally topologically fractal. Integer dimensions are replaced by spectral dimensions. Structure is scale-transcendent and self-similar; perception modules are nested via spectral dimensional compression.</p>

<h2>SUMS–4: Spectral Compression Law μ = 0.016</h2>
<p>All evolution is governed by a unified compression factor μ ≈ 0.016.<br>
μ determines cross-scale transitions, spectral coupling windows, and attention focusing intensity.</p>

<h2>SUMS–5: Spectral Boundary States and Modal Entanglement Axiom</h2>
<p>Spectral boundary states induce inseparable modal entanglement, which gives rise to irreversibility, causality, and the arrow of time.<br>
Future = the direction of spectral compression.</p>

<h2>SUMS–6: Topological Origin of μ</h2>
<p>μ is not an empirical fit but is topologically derived from the structure of the spectral modal space:<br>
μ = 1 / Index(D); μ = Vol(comp) / Vol(raw); μ = dτ / dℓ.</p>
