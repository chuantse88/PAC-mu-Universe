<h1>Philosophical Origins of Spectral Ontology</h1>

<p>From ancient Greek philosophy's notion of "being itself" to modern ontology, language philosophy, and logical realism, humanity has continuously questioned the foundation of existence.</p>

<p>The PAC–μ theory introduces a spectral ontology—a generative, dynamic model of being. It redefines existence as a compressible, activatable, and internally expressible spectral state rather than a static substance. This draws from diverse philosophical traditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plato's idealism — structure as a prior model of truth</li>
  <li>Aristotle's four causes — reinterpretation of formal and final causes</li>
  <li>Spinoza's self-caused substance — ontology must explain itself</li>
  <li>Heidegger's Dasein — being as appearance and unfolding</li>
  <li>Topos-theoretic ontology — unity of logic, language, and truth</li>
</ul>

<p>The central question posed is: <strong>What counts as expressible being?</strong> PAC–μ answers: that which is compressible under μ and expressible through internal logical structure.</p>

<p>Thus, spectral ontology offers not a metaphysical claim, but a generative, computable, and structurally coherent ontological framework.</p>
