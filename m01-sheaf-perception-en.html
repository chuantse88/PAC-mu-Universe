<h1>M01 – Spectral Sheaf and Cognitive Perception in PAC–Q</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In classical models of cognition, perception is often treated as a static input process—raw sensory data filtered and processed into mental representations. However, in the PAC–μ framework, perception is understood as a dynamic, structured phenomenon governed by spectral activation, categorical topology, and the universal compression law μ ≈ 0.016.</p>
<p>This module introduces the concept of <strong>spectral sheaf perception</strong>, where each local region of awareness is defined by a Hilbert space of spectral modes, and the global perception is glued together through sheaf conditions under categorical coherence.</p>

<h2>2. Mathematical Foundations</h2>
<h3>2.1 The Perception Category 𝒞</h3>
<p>Let 𝒞 be a small category representing perceptual regions, sensory domains, or conceptual contexts. Objects in 𝒞 correspond to local zones of awareness (e.g., visual fields, auditory scenes), and morphisms describe inclusion or transformation relations between them.</p>

<h3>2.2 The Spectral Sheaf ℱ</h3>
<p>The perception sheaf is defined as a contravariant functor:</p>
<pre>ℱ: 𝒞<sup>op</sup> → Hilb</pre>
<p>Each object U in 𝒞 is assigned a Hilbert space ℱ(U), whose basis vectors correspond to available modal states (frequency modes, eigenstates, etc.). Each morphism f: V → U induces a restriction map ℱ(f): ℱ(U) → ℱ(V), which represents localized projection of modal awareness.</p>

<h3>2.3 μ as Compression Functional</h3>
<p>The parameter μ ≈ 0.016 acts as a <strong>spectral compression constant</strong>, determining:</p>
<ul>
<li>the resolution threshold of modal distinctions;</li>
<li>the density of accessible modes within each ℱ(U);</li>
<li>the bandwidth of the observer's attention field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Spectral Structures</h2>
<h3>3.1 Ψ: The Perceptual Tensor Field</h3>
<p>The global perceptual state is given by a tensor field:</p>
<pre>Ψ: Dom(ℱ) → ⋃ ℱ(U)</pre>
<p>This field dynamically activates certain modes in ℱ(U) over time, regulated by μ-based attention dynamics. Ψ can be seen as the <em>cognitive energy distribution</em> over the perceptual category.</p>

<h3>3.2 Categorical Integration of Perception</h3>
<p>The sheaf condition ensures that perception is locally defined but globally consistent. Modal fields defined over subobjects must glue coherently to determine the experience over a larger perceptual domain. This reflects phenomena like Gestalt completion, cross-modal integration, and attention coherence.</p>

<h2>4. Applications and Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sheaf-based AI</strong>: PAC–Q models can be used to construct AI systems whose perception is structurally modular, μ-regulated, and cognitively dynamic.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral Attention</strong>: The μ-parameter allows flexible focus and abstraction control—zooming into details or generalizing over higher-level modal categories.</li>
<li><strong>Neuroscience</strong>: The model aligns with brain wave decomposition (α, β, γ) as local modes in ℱ(U), and with neuro-topological dynamics over time via Ψ activation.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness Modeling</strong>: Ψ represents the pre-reflective field of awareness, where conscious content arises as modally selected and temporally stabilized spectral packets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
<p>In PAC–μ, perception is no longer passive input but a sheaf-structured, μ-compressed, dynamically evolving spectral process. This module establishes the mathematical and cognitive foundation for further constructions, including language emergence, spectral AI, and sheaf robotics.</p>
