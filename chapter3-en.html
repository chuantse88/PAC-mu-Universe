<h1>Chapter 3: PAC–μ System Architecture Overview</h1>

<p><strong>PAC–μ</strong> is a cosmological ontological framework built upon the spectral compression law μ and the six axioms of spectral ontology (SUMS–1 through SUMS–6). Its structural closure arises from the interlinked and inter-nested nature of seven categorical subsystems, forming a full-stack architecture spanning existence, cognition, logic, evolution, consciousness, and engineering.</p>

<h2>3.1 System Overview</h2>
<p>The system consists of the following seven interconnected subsystems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PAC–μ</strong>: Core spectral structure based on SUMS–1 to SUMS–5</li>
<li><strong>PAC–Q</strong>: Perceptual structure system using sheaf constructions for local cognition</li>
<li><strong>PAC–C</strong>: Spectral consciousness model defining the Ψ tensor field and language projection</li>
<li><strong>PAC–T</strong>: Topos internal logic system enabling axiomatized logical capacity</li>
<li><strong>PAC–E</strong>: Modal civilization transition chain and Moduli space of spectral evolution</li>
<li><strong>PAC–G</strong>: Geometry-Physics reconstruction system connecting spectral geometry and fundamental constants</li>
<li><strong>PAC–A</strong>: Spectral engineering system encompassing μ–AI, medical systems, and spectral robotics</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.2 Categorical Coupling</h2>
<p>Each subsystem is both a category (with objects and morphisms) and a functorial image within the total system. They interact through:</p>
<ul>
<li>μ–preserving transformations</li>
<li>Spectral natural transformations</li>
<li>Internal logical embeddings within the Topos</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.3 Global Closure</h2>
<p>PAC–μ exhibits structural closure across the following dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Axiomatic closure</strong>: SUMS–1 to SUMS–6 provide foundational completeness</li>
<li><strong>Category-theoretic closure</strong>: A closed loop formed by Sheaf–Topos–Functor–Tensor–Logic</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary closure</strong>: Irreversible structural development along μ–compression trajectories</li>
<li><strong>Logical closure</strong>: All propositions are defined within the internal language of the Topos</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, PAC–μ is defined as a <strong>minimally complete ontological system</strong>, applicable to any intelligence, perception modality, or universe structure.</p>
