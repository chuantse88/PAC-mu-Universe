  <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    The PAC–μ Spectral Ontology Framework is a minimal axiomatic theory grounded in spectral structures, quantum foundations, and modal logic. 
    This introduction lays the philosophical and structural motivations behind PAC–μ and outlines the architecture of the whitepaper.
  </p>
  <h2>1.1 Philosophical Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Physics and cognition reflect deeper universal regularities. PAC–μ argues that the universe is not merely observed but structured through 
    axioms that exist independently of perception. Vision, hearing, and quantum sensing are modalities of the same fundamental ontological layer.
  </p>
  <h2>1.2 Framework Scope</h2>
  <p>
    PAC–μ is built on six spectral axioms (SUMS–1 to SUMS–6), one universal spectral compression law (μ ≈ 0.016), and seven interrelated 
    categorical subsystems (PAC–Q through PAC–A). This allows it to encompass perception, action, logic, space, language, and engineering.
  </p>
  <h2>1.3 Whitepaper Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The following chapters introduce the axioms (SUMS), the categorical architecture of the system, the Topos–Sheaf logic, the PAC–μ AI 
    framework, and engineering applications. Appendices provide terminology, illustrations, and references.
