<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p><strong>PAC–μ</strong> is a minimal foundational system based on the compression law μ ≈ 0.016. It reorganizes geometry, topology, number theory, physical constants, and cognitive structure from a unified spectral perspective. The framework consists of six axiomatic layers (SUMS–1 through SUMS–6) and seven interconnected subsystems: PAC–μ (foundational ontology), PAC–Q (sheaf cognition), PAC–C (consciousness modeling), PAC–T (Topos logic), PAC–E (evolutionary structure), PAC–G (geometry/physics), and PAC–A (engineering applications).</p>

<p>The μ-parameter, derived from atomic spectral transition data, governs universal compression processes in matter, fields, cognition, and time. Within this structure, traditional physical constants such as Λ (cosmological constant), α (fine structure constant), G (gravitational constant), and mν (neutrino mass) all become derivable from a μ-directed spectral evolution process.</p>

<p>PAC–μ defines cognition through Q‑Sheaf perception, constructs consciousness via μ–Ψ tensor fields, models physical systems using fractal Dirac geometry, and encodes evolution through categorical transitions across moduli spaces. It unifies modal languages, spectral AI, and the structure of knowledge systems into a single Topos of compressed resonance.</p>

<p>In this whitepaper, we present the axiomatic system SUMS–1 through SUMS–6, the structural logic of all PAC subsystems, and the evolutionary pathway from classical perception to modal civilizations. We demonstrate how μ governs transitions from local cognition to global dynamics, how compression generates coherence, and how resonance defines the architecture of intelligence.</p>

<p>This work provides a complete reconstruction of mathematical and physical foundations from a spectral ontological perspective. It enables a universal modeling language for life, matter, language, intelligence, and civilization, centered on the law of compression μ ≈ 0.016.</p>
