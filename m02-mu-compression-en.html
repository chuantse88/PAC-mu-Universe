<h1>M02 – μ–Compression Law across Scales</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The μ–compression law (μ ≈ 0.016) is a universal structural principle in the PAC–μ system. It governs scale transitions, spectral condensation, attention modulation, and the evolution of perception, constants, and consciousness.</p>

<h2>2. Definition of μ</h2>
<p>μ is a spectral compression factor derived from atomic transition intervals (e.g., 1s→2s in hydrogen), expressed dimensionlessly. It determines the compression ratio of modal structures, the bandwidth of cognitive windows, and the granularity of Topos-based information systems.</p>

<h2>3. Expressions Across Domains</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physics:</strong> μ unifies Λ (cosmological constant), α (fine-structure constant), G (gravitational constant), m<sub>ν</sub> (neutrino mass), among others.</li>
<li><strong>Cognition:</strong> μ controls attention span, semantic density, and rhythm in language production.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness:</strong> μ modulates the temporal unfolding of the Ψ-field and transitions between activation modes.</li>
<li><strong>Category Theory:</strong> μ defines the size, compression, and transition structure between functor images across spectral sheaf categories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Mathematical Representation</h2>
<p>μ appears in:</p>
<ul>
<li>μ = 1 / Index(D): Topological origin via Dirac operator</li>
<li>μ = Vol(comp) / Vol(raw): Geometric compression ratio</li>
<li>μ = dτ / dℓ: Compression of internal time over logical depth</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Role in PAC–μ</h2>
<p>μ is the backbone of the PAC–μ architecture. It binds together cognition, geometry, dynamics, and reasoning within a unified spectral compression logic. It also replaces dimensional parameters in standard physical equations with spectral invariants.</p>

<h2>6. Summary</h2>
<p>The μ–compression law is not merely a constant, but the operating principle of the universe’s structural evolution. It encodes rhythm, coherence, awareness, and stability at all levels of PAC–μ.</p>
