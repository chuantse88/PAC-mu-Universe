<h1>ðŸ§  PACâ€“Î¼ as a Generative Ontology</h1>

<p>This third paper frames PACâ€“Î¼ as a generative ontology in which existence arises from structural activation, spectral compressibility, and internal logic. Free will is modeled as an internal choice operation Îµ(t) within a topos.</p>

<p>Key concepts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ontology = Compressibility Ã— Activation Ã— Logical Projection</li>
  <li>Îµ(t): Structural freedom as internal logic selection</li>
  <li>Ontological transitions via Î¼-regulated moduli space</li>
</ul>

<p>It culminates in a model of the universe not as a static entity, but as a self-generating topos of compressible truths and evolving structural choices.</p>
