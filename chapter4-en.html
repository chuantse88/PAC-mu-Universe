<h1>Chapter 4: Subsystems Overview (PAC–Q to PAC–A)</h1>

<p>The categorical structure of the entire PAC–μ framework consists of seven interconnected subsystems. Each subsystem has its own independent categorical definition while also interacting through the spectral compression law μ. These interactions form a unified spectral categorical universe spanning perception, consciousness, logic, geometry, evolution, and engineering.</p>

<h2>PAC–Q: Quantum–Sheaf Perception</h2>
<p>All perception is represented as spectral functions over a Q–Sheaf structure F: C<sup>op</sup> → Hilb. Each perceptual region corresponds to a Hilbert space, with local attention windows controlled by μ-compression mappings. The system supports ∞–Sheaf generalization and modal fusion.</p>

<h2>PAC–C: Spectral Consciousness Model</h2>
<p>Defines the consciousness object M = (C, F, μ, Ψ, L), where Ψ(t) is a spectral activation tensor field. μ controls focus and transitions of consciousness. L is the language projection functor that maps spectral tensors into semantic expressions and behavioral responses.</p>

<h2>PAC–T: Topos-Theoretic Logic</h2>
<p>Each spectral system is embedded within a Topos E<sub>μ</sub>, possessing an internal language L<sub>μ</sub> and a subobject classifier Ω<sub>μ</sub>. All reasoning, judgments, and existence conditions are formulated internally within the Topos structure.</p>

<h2>PAC–E: Modal Evolution</h2>
<p>Defines the spectral transition chain among modal universes: U<sub>H</sub> → U<sub>S</sub> → U<sub>Q</sub> → U<sub>T</sub>, constructing the moduli space of spectral civilizations, M<sub>PAC–E</sub>. This structure is organized as a categorical network of spectral Topoi.</p>

<h2>PAC–G: Geometry–Physics Correspondence</h2>
<p>Reconstructs geometric structures using the Dirac operator D and spectral triple (A, H, D). Combines with K-theory to define the system of physical constants. The μ compression law links modal structures across scales, unifying fundamental constants such as Λ, α, m<sub>ν</sub>, and G.</p>

<h2>PAC–A: Spectral Engineering and AI</h2>
<p>Defines the category of spectral engineering, SpecTech, encompassing AI, μ–Sheaf-based medicine, robotics, and more. All systems are controlled through μ-compressed tensor networks. The sheaf activation structure encodes a closed-loop from perception to control to language.</p>

<p>Together, the seven subsystems form the spectral logic universe of PAC–μ and can be functorially mapped onto any modal intelligent structure or physical/engineering system.</p>
